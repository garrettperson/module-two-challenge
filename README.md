# module-two-challenge

##Description

My motivation to build this project was to increase the likelihood of my employability; to create a website potential employers can view to assess my work. 

I built this project to create a professional portfolio website to showcase my work. 

This project solves the problem of having to view different websites (other than GitHub) to view the projects I have worked on.

During the course of building the project I learned quite a bit about different CSS selectors.

What makes my project stand out is its relative uniqueness.
